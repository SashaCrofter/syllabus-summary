# In Summary

Sometimes, it is simpler to author text describing a piece of data than
to explicitly fill out a form, particularly if the data is coming from
another pre-written source, such as a syllabus. Here, I am trying to use
natural language processing to extract
[EduPal](http://edupal.co)-relevant information from short summaries of
syllabus information.
